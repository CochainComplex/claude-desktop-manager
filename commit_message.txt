fix: install Claude Desktop to user directory instead of system paths

The installation process was failing because the bubblewrap sandbox mounts
system directories like /usr/bin as read-only, but the dpkg installation 
was trying to write to these directories.

Changes:
1. Modified installer.sh to manually extract the .deb package instead of 
   using dpkg, and install the claude-desktop binary to ~/.local/bin
2. Updated instance.sh to use the local binary path when launching
3. Added creation of proper desktop entry file in the sandbox
4. Reordered the PATH environment variable to prioritize ~/.local/bin
5. Added test script to verify installation works correctly

This approach avoids the need to modify the read-only mounts in the sandbox
while still allowing the application to be properly installed and run.

Fixes the "Read-only file system" error that occurred during installation.
