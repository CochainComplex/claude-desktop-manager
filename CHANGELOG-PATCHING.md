# Patching System Improvements - Changelog

## Overview

This update improves the app.asar patching system in Claude Desktop Manager, particularly for handling system-wide installations that require elevated permissions.

## Changes

### 1. Permission-Safe Patching

- Modified `patch-app.js` to work with temporary files in user's home directory
- Created a safe patching workflow that doesn't require immediate root access
- Added system to track and apply pending patches

### 2. System Patching Script

- Added `apply-system-patches.sh` script for safely applying patches to system locations
- Script can handle multiple pending patches in a single execution
- Automatically creates backups of original files

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- Better detection of system vs. user installation locations
- Clear error messages and instructions for manual intervention
- Safe fallback mechanisms when automatic patching isn't possible

### 4. Documentation

- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/PATCHING.md`
- Updated README with troubleshooting section for patching issues
- Added inline comments explaining the patching process

## Files Modified

- `/scripts/patch-app.js`: Updated to handle system paths safely
- `/lib/installer.sh`: Improved patching workflow during installation
- `/lib/sandbox.sh`: Added utility function for system file operations
- Added `/scripts/apply-system-patches.sh`: New script for applying patches with elevated permissions
- Added `/docs/PATCHING.md`: Documentation for the patching process
- Updated `README.md`: Added reference to patching docs and troubleshooting section

## Testing

The improved patching system has been tested with:

- System-wide installation in `/usr/lib/claude-desktop/`
- User installation in `~/.local/share/claude-desktop/`
- Various instance configurations and naming patterns

## Usage

For normal usage, the patching system works automatically. For system locations requiring elevated permissions, users can:

1. Complete the instance creation process
2. Run `sudo /path/to/claude-desktop-manager/scripts/apply-system-patches.sh` 
3. Restart the instance to see the changes take effect
